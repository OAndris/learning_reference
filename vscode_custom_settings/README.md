# vscode_custom_settings
Find some custom Visual Studio Code settings here.

Note that simply having these files in your repository won't actually apply the settings defined within them.
- Do not include these files in your repository!
- Instead, copy their contents to the actual files you can open from within VS Code after hitting `Ctrl+Shift+P` and searching for the files (e.g. 'Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)').
