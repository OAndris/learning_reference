# vscode_custom_settings
Find some custom Visual Studio Code settings and setups here.

## Files in this folder:
The files within this folder contain some custom settings for Visual Studio Code. Note that simply having these files in your repository won't actually apply the settings defined within them.
- Do not include these files directly in your repository!
- Instead, **copy their contents to the actual files you can open from within VS Code** after hitting `Ctrl+Shift+P` and searching for the files (e.g. 'Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)').

## Recommended Visual Studio Code extensions:
- Debugger for Chrome
- Live Sass Compiler
- Prettier - Code formatter
- Python
- Material Icon Theme
- Live Server
- Visual Studio IntelliCode
