-   Given a string, check if it is a palindrome by ignoring spaces. (E.g. race car would be a palindrome)
-   Given two very large strings, consisting of only digits, multiply the two strings and return the result as a string
-   Given a string that contains ternary expressions, convert the given ternary expression to a binary tree and return the root
-   Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth
-   Given an array with positive numbers, find the largest subsequence from the array that contain elements which are Fibonacci numbers
-   Given a string in Roman numeral format, convert it to an integer
-   Given an array of N numbers and another number X, determine whether or not there exist three elements in A[] whose sum is exactly X
-   Given an input stream of N integers, insert these numbers into a new stream and find the median of the stream formed by each insertion of X to the new stream
-   Given an array and a number K, find the largest sum of the subarray containing at least K numbers (it may be assumed that the size of the array is at least K)
-   Given an unsorted array A of size N with positive integers, find a continuous sub-array which adds to a given number S
-   Given a dictionary, find all possible words that can be formed by a sequence of adjacent characters (Note that you can move to any of 8 adjacent characters, but a word should not have multiple instances of the same cell)
-   Given two unsorted arrays, A and B, of size N and M, find all pairs from both arrays whose sum is equal to X
-   Given a string S of digits 0 through 9, find the maximum value that can be obtained from the string by putting either '\*' or '+' operators in between the digits while traversing from left to right of the string and picking up a single digit at a time
-   Given two numbers as strings (s1 and s2), multiply them
-   Given a preorder traversal of a BST, print the leaf nodes of the tree without building the tree
-   Given two binary strings (s1 and s2), print the resultant string after adding the two
-   Given an array of integers with both positive and negative numbers, determine whether it contains a triplet that sums up to zero
-   Given a binary tree in which each node element contains a number, find the maximum possible sum from one leaf node to another
    Create a function called “strstr”, which takes two strings as arguments (S, X) and locates the occurrence of the string X in the string S. The function has to return an integer denoting the first occurrence of the string X in S
-   Given an integer array and an integer K, find the number of subarrays in which all elements are less than K
-   Given K sorted (ascending) arrays with N elements in each array, implement an iterator for iterating over the elements of the arrays in ascending order
-   Given a length N, count the number of strings of length N that can be made using “A”, “B” and “C” with a maximum of one “B” and two “C”s allowed
-   Given an integer “N”, create an array such that each value is repeated twice (For example, 4 = 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4)
-   Given an arbitrary tree, remove all nodes that have a data value of 0
-   Given an integer, print an English phrase that describes the integer (For example, 240 = “Two hundred and forty”)
-   Given 2 strings representing very large numbers (bigger than what you can represent with a BigInteger and similar types of variables), write a method for adding the two numbers and returning their sum
