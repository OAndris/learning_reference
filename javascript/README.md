## About:

Some characteristics of JavaScript:

- high level programming (scripting) language
- dynamically typed
- weakly typed
- interpreted

Additional characteristics:

- JavaScript runs in the browser and is used to make interactive websites
- it is one of the three core technologies of the web:
  - HTML (content)
  - CSS (presentation / styling)
  - JavaScript (interactivity - interacts with both HTML and CSS)
- JavaScript is standardized in the ECMAScript language specification (JavaScript conforms to the ever-evolving ECMAScript standard)
- browsers use the ECMAScript specification to interpret JavaScript
- browsers are slow to adopt to new technology - the newest ECMAScript specificaitons are often not (yet) implemented by all browsers
- using a transpiler (e.g. Babel) enables us to use the newest JavaScript features and syntax, and then transpile it to an older syntax that can also be interpreted by the browsers

## Fun facts about JavaScript:

- Jeremy Keith once said: "Java is to JavaScript what ham is to hamster." (others: car and carpet; cat and catfish; fire and firefox)
  - Java is a programming language used to write applications for computers and other devices
  - JavaScript is a scripting language used to interact with content in a web browser and more recently in other places
- JavaScript was originally called Mocha, then renamed to LiveScript, and finally to JavaScript, when Netscape and Sun Microsystems did a licensing agreement that included the language. The idea was to create a scripting language complementary to Java and cash in on Java's popularity (thus the confusing name choice).

## jQuery:

- jQuery is a JavaScript library that contains additional JavaScript functions
- it introduces a CSS-like syntax and several visual and UI enhancements
- simplifies the use of JavaScript in websites
- an abstraction of the core language

## JavaScript frameworks:

- AngularJS, React and Vue.js are front-end application frameworks used to simplify the building of advanced interactive web-based applications
- traditional technologies (e.g. PHP) generate the HTML files on the server and send them to the browser
- these newer technologies use just a single (and simple) HTML file, which is then updated via JavaScript in the browser. Instead of pre-built HTML files, the server just sends data, which is then used by JavaScript to update the single HTML file

## JavaScript platforms and runtime environments:

- these tools allow us to use JavaScript as a server site language
- Node.js is a JavaScript platform built on browser runtime environments
