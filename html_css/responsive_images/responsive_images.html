        <p>Examples for "Pixel Resolution" and "Art Direction".</p>
        <p>
            Note that these techniques alone do not solve all problems regarding responsive web design. They should be
            used together with responsive CSS (e.g. flexbox, CSS grid, relative width/height, max-width, max-height, img
            object-fit, media queries, etc.), as well as lazy loading, progressive loading, and graceful loading. But
            these two HTML based techniques can save a lot on bandwidth and load time, thus adding a lot to the
            performance of the website, by enabling the browser to load the smallest possible image for each screen size
            and screen resolution.

        <h2>"Pixel Resolution" (resolution switching)</h2>
        <p>
            From MDN:
            <i
                >"The problem whereby you want to serve smaller image files to narrow-screen devices, as they don't need
                huge images like desktop displays do — and to serve different resolution images to high density/low
                density screens. You can solve this problem using vector graphics (SVG images) and the srcset with sizes
                attributes."
            </i>
        </p>
        <p>In this example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If the screen width is 900px or smaller, the browser loads a JPG with 640px width (96 KB).</li>
            <li>If the screen width is larger than 900px, the browser loads a JPG with 1280px width (318 KB).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The loaded picture:</p>
        <img
            srcset="goat-landscape-640px.jpg 640w, goat-landscape-1280px.jpg 1280w"
            sizes="(max-width: 900px) 640px,
                1280px"
            src="goat-landscape-1280px.jpg"
            alt=""
        />

        <hr />

        <h2>"Art Direction" (picture switching)</h2>
        <p>
            From MDN:
            <i
                >"The problem whereby you want to serve cropped images for different layouts — for example a landscape
                image showing a full scene for a desktop layout, and a portrait image showing the main subject zoomed in
                for a mobile layout. You can solve this problem using the picture element."
            </i>
        </p>
        <p>In this example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                If the screen width is 900px or smaller, the browser loads a portrait JPG (which is not only smaller in
                size than the large landscape image, but it also allows to focus more on the most important detail of
                the original picture, potentially).
            </li>
            <li>If the screen width is larger than 900px, the browser loads a landscape JPG.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the browser doesn't support the "picture" HTML element, the default (landscape) JPG gets loaded.</p>
        <p>The loaded picture:</p>
        <picture>
            <source media="(max-width: 900px)" srcset="goat-portrait-640px.jpg" />
            <img src="goat-landscape-1280px.jpg" alt="" />
        </picture>
